        <p>The PE-MVE from BAUER is the compact complete solution in a vertical format for all applications requiring medium delivery rates. Equipped with noise insulation housing as standard, the PE-MVE is ideal for use in environments where noise is a key concern and for customers who need reliable and durable service combined with low running costs.
What's more, the high-pressure compressors are already equipped with an automatic condensate drain and easy-to-use BHW CONTROL, which has a fully automatic mode for filling storage bottles.
